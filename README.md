A Terraform plan to install and configure Chef Delivery and its components:

* Chef Server 12
* Chef Delivery
* Chef Build Nodes (3) for Chef Delivery
* Chef Supermarket
* Chef Compliance
* Chef Analytics


Usage
------------

##### 1) Download your Delivery license key
Delivery requires a valid license to activate successfully. **If you do
not have a license key, you can request one from your CHEF account
representative.**

You will need to have the `delivery.license` file present inside `.chef/`
directory.

##### 2) Install and Configure ChefDK

Follow the instructions at https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html to install and configure chefdk as your default version of ruby.

##### 3) Install Terraform

Downloads are here: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html . Place in your path for direct execution.

##### 4) Create and populate `terraform.tfvars` at the root of the repository

```
# Terraform Variables File
# Delivery Cluster Settings
aws_access_key_id = "<KEY>"
aws_secret_access_key = "<SECRET>"
aws_default_region = "us-west-2"
aws_key_pair_name = "<KEY-PAIR-NAME>"
chef-delivery-enterprise = "terraform"
chef-server-organization = "terraform"
```

##### 5) Store your key-pair pem file inside `.keys/`

##### 6) Load the Terraform Modules and apply the Plan

```
$ terraform get
$ terraform apply
```

#### Access to Delivery Cluster

At this time you should have your Delivery Cluster up & running.

Now it is time to get access. You can use the `admin` credentials shown by:

```
$ terraform output -module=chef-delivery
chef-delivery-creds = Created enterprise: terraform
Admin username: admin
Admin password: RnjR44L87qgG6Pt3t+QDZghyZlUY2gEQxMk=
Builder Password: PE3XDjesPbMAyzkVnKEsrOBaIX5yZtNHhtQ=
Web login: https://54.148.123.123/e/terraform/

chef-delivery-enterprise = terraform
chef-delivery-public-ip = 54.148.123.123
```
